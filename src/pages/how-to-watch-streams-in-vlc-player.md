VLC Player has a neat feature that allows you to watch high quality streams. Here is a small list of how to watch them.
<ol>
	<li><a title="VLC Player" href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/#download" target="_blank">Download VLC Player</a> (if you don't already have it)</li>
	<li>Open Network Stream (Ctrl + N on Windows)</li>
	<li>Copy and paste the link address</li>
	<li>Hit Go</li>
</ol>
If you are having lag issues:
<ol>
	<li>Go to VLC Preferences -&gt; Select Show All</li>
	<li>Then go to Preferences -&gt; Input/Codecs -&gt; set Network Caching to 5000ms or more</li>
</ol>
If that doesn't help try a lower bitrate or quality by switching the 4500 in the link address to 3000, ipad, 1600, iphone, or 800.
