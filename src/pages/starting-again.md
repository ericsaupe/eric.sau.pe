Hello,

Welcome to my new blog.  Created for me to take notes on my every day workings and findings in the areas of web development and computer science.  I will try to update regularly with notes that I take each day working on the various projects that I do.

A little about myself, I am a recent graduate of the University of Utah with a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science.  I work full-time as the software engineering manager for a textile testing company and do sub-contract work on the side.  I created this blog as a place to keep my notes, establish discussion, and learn the tricks of programming and designing WordPress sites.

The site is named Eric Saupe, as that is my name, and the tagline (for now) is Things my wife doesn’t understand.  Often while I was at school and coming home from work I would want to tell someone about the cool new things I learned or discovered and my wife, Carly, was always the only one around so I would tell her.  She would smile and nod her head but she would often tell me that she has no idea what I’m talking about nor does she care if I’ve created an algorithm to minimize BDD variable lists or found a cool new way to generate and save forms using Django.  I needed a place to let my thoughts go and this is what I hope to accomplish with this site.

I hope you come back often and I hope it is as beneficial for you as I hope it will be for me.

\-Eric
