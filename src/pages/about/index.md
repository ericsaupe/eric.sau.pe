### Software Developer

I'm a Computer Science graduate from the University of Utah and work full time as a web developer. I have experience developing production applications in Ruby on Rails, Django, Python, and Go to name a few.

### Father

My wife and I have two young daughters and when I'm not programming I'm usually trying to keep up with them. They love to dance and pretend.

### Gamer

Gaming has been a passion of mine basically all my life. Normally I only have time for Overwatch but have been dabbling in Fortnite lately.
