The year is over and Wordpress has kindly sent me a summary of that stats for my blog.  The growth has been more than I ever expected.  I still consider this a personal blog for my own edification and learning but I'm glad I could share my knowledge and problems with so many.  In the coming year I would like to focus a bit more on Django and Python but understand that a lot of people really want front end help and so I will continue to post about JavaScript and CSS.

Thanks again for visiting my blog.  I hope it helps you as much as it helps me.
