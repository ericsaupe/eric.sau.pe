Just a quick note for everyone, Bootstrap has officially released version 3.0.0 as of Monday.  If you have been following along with the blog so far you'll already be familiar with the major changes to Bootstrap.  This final release fixes a lot of those bugs that I've brought up here.  It is now stable and ready for production.  The biggest complaint I've seen from people is the move to the flat theme by default where the 2.3.2 version was polished and looked nice.  The good news is that Bootstrap allows you to use the new version with the old look, problem solved!  We are going to continue with the flat look because we like it but it's totally up to you how you use Bootstrap.  <a title="Bootstrap" href="http://blog.getbootstrap.com/2013/08/19/bootstrap-3-released/" target="_blank">Full release notes here.</a>  Good luck!
