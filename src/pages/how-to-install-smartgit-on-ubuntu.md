I've found that a lot of things on Ubuntu are very easy to install but there are some trickery ones that if you don't know the procedure can be a pain to get up and running on a new installation.  Here is a quick setup guide for getting SmartGit installed on a fresh Ubuntu installation.
<ol>
	<li>Install the Java Runtime Environment from here.  <a href="http://apt.ubuntu.com/p/openjdk-7-jre">http://apt.ubuntu.com/p/openjdk-7-jre</a></li>
	<li>Install Git with the command <code>sudo apt-get install git-core</code></li>
	<li>Install Mercurial with the command <code>sudo apt-get install mercurial meld</code></li>
	<li>Download and <a title="SmartGit" href="http://www.syntevo.com/smartgithg/" target="_blank">install SmartGit</a> per their instructions on their site</li>
</ol>
That's all there is to it.  Hope this helps both myself and anyone else looking for a quick guide to get SmartGit up and running.
